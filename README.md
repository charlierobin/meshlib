# A simple “library” window for Unity

I have a few folders which contain assets I like to be able to quickly import: mainly a library of 3D primitives that's a little bit more comprehensive than the native Unity one.

After all, when just noodling around and seeing how something might work, I just want quick one click access to a selection of simple shapes, a selection that I can quickly update from other 3rd party applications as well.
